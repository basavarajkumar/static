    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Welcome to DesiMitraAI. By using this application, you agree to the
        following terms and conditions. Please read them carefully before
        proceeding.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1. Application Usage</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          DesiMitraAI is an AI-powered chat application designed for
          conversational support, guidance, and entertainment within culturally
          sensitive Indian family contexts.
        </li>
        <li>
          The app offers multiple AI personalities (e.g., Romantic Partner, Life
          Partner, Daughter, Mother) for simulated conversations. These
          personalities are for informational and entertainment purposes only.
        </li>
        <li>You must be at least 13 years old to use this application.</li>
        <li>
          You agree not to use the app for unlawful, harmful, or abusive
          purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          The app may store conversation history and preferences locally on your
          device for a better user experience.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. AI Behavior and Limitations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Conversations are generated by artificial intelligence and may not
          always be accurate, complete, or appropriate for every situation.
        </li>
        <li>
          The AI is designed to avoid explicit, harmful, or illegal content and
          to respect cultural and family boundaries. However, responses may
          occasionally be imperfect.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not rely on the AI for medical, legal, financial, or emergency
          advice. Always consult a qualified professional for such matters.
        </li>
        <li>
          The AI does not have consciousness, emotions, or personal opinions.
          All responses are generated based on patterns in data and predefined
          personality prompts.
        </li>
        <li>
          The app may use third-party AI services (such as OpenAI or Claude) to
          generate responses. Your messages may be processed by these services
          in accordance with their privacy policies.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. Privacy and Data</h2>

          DesiMitraAI values your privacy. Personal data is handled according to
          our

        </li>
        <li>
          Conversation data may be used to improve the quality of the AI and
          user experience, but will not be shared with third parties except as
          required by law or for AI processing.
        </li>
        <li>
          You are responsible for not sharing sensitive personal information in
